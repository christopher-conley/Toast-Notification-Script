## What's New

- 2.3.0 â€“ Added the Register-CustomNotificationApp function
   - This function retrieves the value of the CustomNotificationApp option from the config.xml
      - The function then uses this name, to create a custom app for doing the notification
      - This will reflect in the shown toast notification, instead of Software Center or PowerShell
   - This also creates the custom notifcation app with a prevention from disabling the toast notifications via the UI
